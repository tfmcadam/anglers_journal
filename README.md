This is my first full-stack project that I did while at Coding Dojo.

I used flask in python with Bcrypt for a more secure log in.

Google Maps APi is utilized to track information the user enters into MySQL for geolocation. 

Some Bootstrap and custom CSS have been implemented for a cleaner look. 

More features/styling to be added in the near future. 

Another work in progress.
